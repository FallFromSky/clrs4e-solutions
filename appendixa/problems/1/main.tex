In order to determine the asymptotic tight bounds on each summation, we will find their asymptotic upper bound and asymptotic lower bound by substituting each term in the summations by appropriate values.
Since the bounds on the summations don't depend on the parity of $n$, for simplicity we will assume that $n$ is even.
