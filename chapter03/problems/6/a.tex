Let $c$ be a positive constant.
Suppose that $f(n)\ge cg(n)$ for $n$ in some set $S$.
If $S$ is infinite, then since $g(n)$ is asymptotically nonnegative, $f(n)=\oset{\infty}{\Omega}(g(n))$.
Now suppose $S$ is finite and let $n_0\in S$ be the largest value for which the above inequality holds.
Then, $cg(n)>f(n)$ for all $n\ge n_0+1$, and since $f(n)$ is asymptotically nonnegative, $f(n)=O(g(n))$.

Theorem 3.1 remains true if we substitute $\oset{\infty}{\Omega}$ for $\Omega$.
