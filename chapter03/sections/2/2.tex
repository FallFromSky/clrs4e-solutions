Let $T(n)$ be the running time of algorithm $A$.
The statement ``$T(n)$ is at least $O(n^2)$'' means that $T(n)\ge f(n)$, where $f(n)=O(n^2)$.
In particular, we can choose $f(n)=0$, and the statement will remain true for any $T(n)$.
Thus, the statement does not characterize $T(n)$ in any meaningful way.
