Suppose the set is nonempty and let $f(n)\in o(g(n))\cap\omega(g(n))$.
Then both relations $f(n)=o(g(n))$ and $f(n)=\omega(g(n))$ hold, which means that for any positive constants $c_1$ and $c_2$ there exists a positive constant $n_0$ such that $c_1g(n)<f(n)<c_2g(n)$ for all $n\ge n_0$.
This statement is a contradiction, because it is not true that $c_1<c_2$ for every two numbers $c_1$ and $c_2$.
Hence, $o(g(n))\cap\omega(g(n))=\emptyset$.
