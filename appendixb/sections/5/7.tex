The proof is by induction on the number $n$ of nodes of the tree.
In the empty tree (where $n=0$) the sum of the leaf weights is 0, which obviously satisfies the inequality.
When $n=1$, then the tree consists of a single leaf with a depth of 0, so the sum of the leaf weights is $2^{-0}=1$.

Now suppose that $n>1$ and that the inequality holds for trees with less than $n$ nodes.
Let $T$ be a binary tree with $n$ nodes, and let $T_L$, $T_R$ be its left and right subtrees, respectively.
By the inductive hypothesis, we have that the inequality is satisfied separately for trees $T_L$ and $T_R$.
The depth of a leaf in tree $T$ is 1 greater than the depth of the same leaf in either $T_L$ or $T_R$, hence the weights of the leaves of $T$ are half as compared to the weights of the same leaves in its subtrees.
Thus, in tree $T$ both the sum of the leaf weights from $T_L$, as well as the sum of the leaf weights from $T_R$ do not exceed $1/2$, and so the total sum of the leaf weights in $T$ does not exceed 1.
