We construct a sequence of full binary trees $T_1$, $T_2$, \dots, as follows.
Let $T_1$ be a binary tree containing a single node, which obviously is a single leaf.
For any $k\ge2$, let $T_k$ be a binary tree whose left subtree is $T_{k-1}$ and whose right subtree is a one-node binary tree.
Given that $T_{k-1}$ has $k-1$ leaves, $T_k$ has $(k-1)+1=k$ leaves.
