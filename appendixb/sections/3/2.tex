The function $f(x)=x+1$, with $\mathbb{N}$ as both the domain and the codomain, is not bijective because there is no $x\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $f(x)=0$.
If we consider $\mathbb{Z}$ as the domain and the codomain, then $f$ becomes bijective, since every integer $y$ in the codomain is an image under $f$ of a uniquely determined integer in the domain: $y=f(y-1)$.
