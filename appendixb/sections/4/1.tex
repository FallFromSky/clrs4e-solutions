We can represent the relation of ``shaking hands'' on the faculty party as an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, where $V$ is the set of professors attending the party and $E$ is the set of unordered pairs of professors who shook hands.
Summing up the degrees of all vertices of $G$, we get twice the number of its edges, because each edge is incident on exactly two vertices.
