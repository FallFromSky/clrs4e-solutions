A hypergraph $H=(V_H,E_H)$ can be represented as a bipartite graph $G=(V_1\cup V_2,E)$, where $V_1=V_H$ and $V_2=E_H$.
A pair $\{v_1,v_2\}$, such that $v_1\in V_1$ and $v_2\in V_2$, is an edge of the graph $G$, if and only if the hyperedge $v_2$ is incident on vertex $v_1$ in the hypergraph $H$.
In the graph $G$ there are no edges between elements of $V_1$ or between elements of $V_2$, so $G$ is indeed bipartite.
