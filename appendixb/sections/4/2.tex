Let $\langle v_0$, $v_1$, \dots, $v_n\rangle$ be a path from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$ in a directed or undirected graph.
If the path is simple, the vertices in the path are distinct.
Otherwise, the path contains a cycle $\langle v_i$, $v_{i+1}$, \dots, $v_{i+k}$, $v_i\rangle$ for some $i$ and $k$, and by eliminating the subpath $\langle v_i$, $v_{i+1}$, \dots, $v_{i+k}\rangle$ from the path, we discard an extra repetition of $v_i$.
By applying this modification until we remove all such repetitions, we obtain a simple path from $u$ to $v$.

The proof for cycles is analogous with $v_0=v_n$ and we have to remember not to remove the very last repetition of $v_0$, required for the path to form a cycle.
