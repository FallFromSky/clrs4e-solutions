We prove by induction on the cardinality of the set $S$.

When $|S|=0$, it holds that $|2^S|=2^{|S|}=1$, because $S$ has exactly one subset\dash the empty set.
Now let $|S|>0$ and assume that $|2^S|=2^{|S|}$.
Choose $p\notin S$ and consider the set $S'=S\cup\{p\}$.
We can divide the subsets of $S'$ into those that contain $p$ and those that do not contain $p$.
By the inductive hypothesis there are $|2^S|=\bigl|2^{S'-\{p\}}\bigr|=2^{|S'-\{p\}|}$ of the latter.
In fact there are as many subsets containing $p$, because each is formed as a union of the singleton $\{p\}$ with some subset not containing $p$.
Thus we have:
\begin{align*}
    \bigl|2^{S'}\bigr| &= 2\cdot2^{|S'-\{p\}|} \\
    &= 2^{|S'-\{p\}|+1} \\
    &= 2^{|S'|}.
\end{align*}
