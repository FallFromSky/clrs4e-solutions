\subproblem
The fact trivially holds for binary trees with at most three nodes, so in the rest of the proof we will assume that $n\ge4$.
For a given binary tree consider a sequence of nodes $\langle x_0$, $x_1$, \dots, $x_k\rangle$, where $x_0$ is the root, $x_k$ is a leaf, and for $i=1$, 2, \dots, $k$, $x_i$ is the root of the subtree of $x_{i-1}$ with more nodes.
Let's denote by $s(x)$ the number of nodes in the subtree rooted at $x$.
For every $i=0$, 1, \dots, $k-1$,
\[
    s(x_i) \le 2s(x_{i+1})+1.
\]
Of course, the sequence $\langle s(x_0)$, $s(x_1)$, \dots, $s(x_k)\rangle$ decreases from $n$ to 1, so there must be $j$, such that $s(x_j)>n/4$ and $s(x_{j+1})\le n/4$.
Thus, by removing edge $(x_{j-1},x_j)$, we partition the nodes of the tree into two sets of sizes
\begin{align*}
    s(x_j) &\le 2n/4+1 \\
    &\le 3n/4
\end{align*}
and
\begin{align*}
    n-s(x_j) &< n-n/4 \\
    &= 3n/4.
\end{align*}
