\subproblem
For a given tree let us distinguish any of its nodes and view the tree as a rooted tree in that node.
Edges in such a tree are incident on nodes from adjacent levels, so nodes can be colored according to the parity of their depth in the tree (e.g., those on odd levels get color 1, and those on even levels get color 2).
