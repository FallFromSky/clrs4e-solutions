\begin{theorem}
    In any undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, where $|V|\ge2$, there are two vertices with the same degree.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    The degrees of the vertices in graph $G$ are numbers from 0 to $|V|-1$, inclusive.
    Observe, however, that $G$ has an isolated vertex if and only if it doesn't have a vertex adjacent to any other vertex of $G$.
    Therefore, the degrees of the vertices of $G$ can in fact take $|V|-1$ possible values, so some two vertices must have equal degrees.
\end{proof}
