Let's represent the outcome of the experiment as a 3-string over $\{{\scriptstyle\rm H},{\scriptstyle\rm T}\}$, with the first two elements denoting the results of Professor Rosencrantz's both tosses, and the last element denoting the result of Professor Guildenstern's toss.
The sample space consists of $2^3=8$ elementary events.
The probability that Professor Rosencrantz obtains strictly more heads than Professor Guildenstern is
\begin{align*}
    \Pr{{\scriptstyle\rm HHH},{\scriptstyle\rm HHT},{\scriptstyle\rm HTT},{\scriptstyle\rm THT}} &= \Pr{\scriptstyle\rm HHH}+\Pr{\scriptstyle\rm HHT}+\Pr{\scriptstyle\rm HTT}+\Pr{\scriptstyle\rm THT} \\
    &= 1/2.
\end{align*}
