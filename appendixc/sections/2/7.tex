Suppose we have two coins\dash a fair one and a biased one that always comes up heads.
We will randomly pick one of the coins and flip it twice.
Let $A$ be the event, that the first flip resulted in heads, let $B$ be the event that the second flip resulted in heads, and let $C$ be the event that the fair coin was picked.
Then,
\begin{align*}
    \prob{A} &= \prob{B} \\
    &= (1/2)\cdot(1/2)+(1/2)\cdot1 \\
    &= 3/4, \\
    \prob{C} &= 1/2.
\end{align*}
The events $A$ and $B$ are not independent, since
\begin{align*}
    \prob{A\cap B} &= (1/2)\cdot(1/4)+(1/2)\cdot1 \\
    &= 5/8,
\end{align*}
while $\prob{A}\prob{B}=9/16$.
But $A$ and $B$ are conditionally independent, given $C$:
\begin{align*}
    \prob{A\cap B\mid C} &= 1/4 \\
    &= (1/2)\cdot(1/2) \\
    &= \prob{A\mid C}\prob{B\mid C}.
\end{align*}
