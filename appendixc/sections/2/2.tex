Let $C_1$, $C_2$, \dots\ be a finite or countably infinite sequence of events, where
\[
    C_i = A_i-\bigcup_{j=1}^{i-1}A_j
\]
for every $i=1$, 2, \dots.
Because $\bigcup_iA_i=\bigcup_iC_i$ and any two events $C_j$, $C_k$, where $j\ne k$, are mutually exclusive, we get
\begin{align*}
    \Pr{\bigcup_iA_i} &= \Pr{\bigcup_iC_i} \\
    &= \sum_i\Pr{C_i} \\
    &\le \sum_i\Pr{A_i}.
\end{align*}
The last inequality holds, since $\Pr{C_i}\le\Pr{A_i}$ for every $i=1$, 2, \dots.
