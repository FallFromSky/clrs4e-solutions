Let $J$, $T$, and $C$ be the events that Jeff, Tim and Carmine will pass the course, respectively.
Furthermore, let $G$ be the event that Professor Gore pointed out that Jeff is the one who will fail.
Since the professor can't reveal Carmine's outcome, there must be $\Pr{G\mid J}=0$, $\Pr{G\mid T}=1$, and $\Pr{G\mid C}=1/2$.
Before talking to the professor, Carmine knows that his probability of passing is $\Pr{C}=1/3$.
His situation after the conversation is described by the event $C\mid G$.

Since $G=(G\cap J)\cup(G\cap T)\cup(G\cap C)$ and since $G\cap J$, $G\cap T$ and $G\cap C$ are mutually exclusive events,
\begin{align*}
    \Pr{G} &= \Pr{G\cap J}+\Pr{G\cap T}+\Pr{G\cap C} \\
    &= \Pr{J}\Pr{G\mid J}+\Pr{T}\Pr{G\mid T}+\Pr{C}\Pr{G\mid C}.
\end{align*}
Using Bayes's theorem, we obtain
\begin{align*}
    \Pr{C\mid G} &= \frac{\Pr{C}\Pr{G\mid C}}{\Pr{G}} \\
    &= \frac{\Pr{C}\Pr{G\mid C}}{\Pr{J}\Pr{G\mid J}+\Pr{T}\Pr{G\mid T}+\Pr{C}\Pr{G\mid C}} \\[2mm]
    &= \frac{(1/3)\cdot(1/2)}{(1/3)\cdot0+(1/3)\cdot1+(1/3)\cdot(1/2)} \\[1mm]
    &= 1/3.
\end{align*}
Thus, the information that Carmine has obtained does not change his chance of passing.
