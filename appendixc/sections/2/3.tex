Let $n_1$, $n_2$, $n_3$ be the numbers on the selected cards, in order of removing the cards from the deck.
Consider the events $A=\{n_1<n_2\}$ and $B=\{n_2<n_3\}$.
If $A$ occurs, then $n_1$ could have been chosen in $n_2-1$ ways.
Similarly, if $B$ occurs, then $n_3$ can be chosen in $10-n_2$ ways.
We need to calculate $\Pr{A\cap B}$.
The number of outcomes in $A\cap B$ is
\[
    \sum_{n_2=1}^{10}(n_2-1)(10-n_2) = 120.
\]
The sample space consists of all possible ordered triples of cards (3-permutations) selected from the deck.
By (C.1), the sample space has the size of $10!/7!=720$.
Thus,
\begin{align*}
    \Pr{A\cap B} &= 120/720 \\
    &= 1/6.
\end{align*}
