Let $S$ be an $n$-set and let $s\in S$.
The set $S$ has $\binom{n}{k}$ $k$-subsets, for $0\le k\le n$.
We can divide these $k$-subsets into those that do not contain $s$ and those that do contain $s$.
There are $\binom{n-1}{k}$ of the former and $\binom{n-1}{k-1}$ of the latter.
Hence, we have
\[
    \binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k}+\binom{n-1}{k-1}.
\]
