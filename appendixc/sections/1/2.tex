Consider the set of $n$-bit integers $N=\{0$, 1, \dots, $2^n-1\}$ and the set of $m$-bit integers $M=\{0$, 1, \dots, $2^m-1\}$.
We are counting functions $f:N\to M$ or, equivalently, sequences $\langle a_1,\dots,a_{2^n}\!\rangle$ with terms from $M$.
We can choose each term in such a sequence in $2^m$ ways, so following the rule of product gives us
\[
    (2^m)^{2^n}=2^{m2^n}
\]
possibilities in total for the number of sequences or the number of $n$-input, $m$-output boolean functions.
Specifically, there is
\[
    2^{2^n}
\]
$n$-input, 1-output boolean functions.
