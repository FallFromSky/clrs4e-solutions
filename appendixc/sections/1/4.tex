Three integers add up to an even number only if all of them are even, or if exactly one of them is even.
There are 49 even and 50 odd numbers in the set $\{1$, 2, \dots, $99\}$, so in the first option we can make a choice in $\binom{49}{3}$ ways, and in the second\dash in $\binom{50}{2}\binom{49}{1}$ ways.
Therefore, the total number of ways is
\[
    \binom{49}{3}+\binom{50}{2}\binom{49}{1} = 78{,}449.
\]
