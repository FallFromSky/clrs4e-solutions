\begin{proof}[Proof of Corollary C.6]
    Let $Y$ be the random variable denoting the total number of failures in this experiment.
    Then, $\Pr{X>k}=\Pr{Y<n-k}$.
    Since $np<k<n$, or $0<n-k<nq$, we can apply Theorem C.4 for $Y$, after inverting the roles of successes and failures, to obtain the desired inequality.
\end{proof}
\end{minipage}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Corollary C.7]
    Similarly as in the previous proof, let's treat the probability of getting more than $k$ successes as the probability of getting fewer than $n-k$ failures.
    Since $(np+n)/2<k<n$, we have $0<n-k<nq/2$, and after swapping the roles of successes and failures, the result follows from Corollary C.5.
\end{proof}
