We have a success when of all six coins, any three came up heads and the other three came up tails\dash it is therefore $\binom{6}{3}=20$ ways to obtain a success.
There are $2^6=64$ possible outcomes, so the probability of success is $p=20/64=5/16$.
By (C.36), before obtaining one we need to make $1/p\approx3.2$ flips on average.
