Let $X$ be a random variable representing the number of trials before obtaining a success in a sequence of Bernoulli trials, where a success occurs with probability $p>0$ and a failure with probability $q=1-p$.
Then,
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{k=1}^\infty\Pr{X=k} &= \sum_{k=1}^\infty q^{k-1}p \\
    &= p\sum_{k=0}^\infty q^k \\
    &= \frac{p}{1-q} && \text{(by equation (A.7))} \\[1mm]
    &= 1,
\end{align*}
so axiom 2 of the probability axioms holds.
