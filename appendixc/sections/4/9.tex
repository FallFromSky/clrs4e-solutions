Let $X'$ be the random variable denoting the number of successes in a series of Bernoulli trials, each with a probability $p$ of success.
Using the result from \refExercise{C.4-10}, where $p_i'=p$ for every $i=1$, 2, \dots, $n$, gives
\[
    \Pr{X\ge k} \le \Pr{X'\ge k}.
\]
The random variable $X'$ has a binomial distribution, so the above inequality can be reformulated as
\[
    \Pr{X\ge k} \le \sum_{i=k}^nb(i;n,p).
\]
Then,
\begin{align*}
    \Pr{X<k} &= 1-\Pr{X\ge k} \\
    &\ge \sum_{i=0}^nb(i;n,p)-\sum_{i=k}^nb(i;n,p) && \text{(by equation (C.40))} \\
    &= \sum_{i=0}^{k-1}b(i;n,p).
\end{align*}
