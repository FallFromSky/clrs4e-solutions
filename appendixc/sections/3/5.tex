According to the definition of independent random variables $X$ and $Y$, for all $x$ and $y$, we have
\[
    \Pr{X=x\;\text{and}\;Y=y} = \Pr{X=x}\Pr{Y=y}.
\]
Let $f$ and $g$ be any functions over the reals.
If $X=x$, then $f(X)=f(x)$, and similarly, if $Y=y$, then $g(Y)=g(y)$.
Therefore, we can write the above formula as
\[
    \Pr{f(X)=f(x)\;\text{and}\;g(Y)=g(y)} = \Pr{f(X)=f(x)}\Pr{g(Y)=g(y)},
\]
from which we conclude that $f(X)$ and $g(Y)$ are independent random variables.
