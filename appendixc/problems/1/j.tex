In part (i) we showed that for any value of $\pswitch$ other than $1/2$, Monty can always find a strategy that will reduce our chances of winning, as compared to the situation when we choose $\pswitch=1/2$.

In this problem we studied different strategies for Monty and for the player.
The analysis of the original problem showed that switching can actually double the player's chances of winning the game, which for most people may seem counterintuitive.
We have seen that for any Monty's strategy, there is an optimal strategy that the player can follow in order to maximize their chances to win, given that they know the Monty's plan.
And vice versa, knowing how the player will act, Monty can always reduce the player's chances.
