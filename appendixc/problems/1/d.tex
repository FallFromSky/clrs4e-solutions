In order to minimize our chances $\pwin$ of winning, given $\pswitch>0$, Monty needs to minimize the term $2\pwrong\pswitch$, as well as maximize the term $\pright\pswitch$.
Therefore, his best strategy is $\pright=1$ and $\pwrong=0$.
With such values, our chances of winning are
\begin{align*}
    \pwin &= (1-\pswitch)/3 \\
    &< 1/3.
\end{align*}
