Compared to the situation from part (b), here we are not distinguishing the balls, so every permutation of them\dash with the positions of the sticks unchanged\dash represents the same arrangement of the balls in the bins.
Thus, we have $\frac{(b+n-1)!}{n!\,(b-1)!}=\binom{b+n-1}{n}$ ways to place the balls.
