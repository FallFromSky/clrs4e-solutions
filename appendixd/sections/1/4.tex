Let $PA=A'=(a_{ij}')$.
Suppose that for $i=1$, 2, \dots, $n$, row $i$ of the matrix $P$ has 1 in column $c_i$ (i.e., $p_{ic_i}=1$).
Then,
\begin{align*}
    a_{ij}' &= \sum_{k=1}^np_{ik}a_{kj} \\
    &= p_{ic_i}a_{c_ij} \\
    &= a_{c_ij}.
\end{align*}
Therefore, the element $a_{ij}'$ in the matrix $PA$ is an element from $A$ from the same row but possibly from a different column.
This means that $PA$ is formed by permuting rows of $A$.

Similarly, let $AP=A''=(a_{ij}'')$ and for $j=1$, 2, \dots, $n$ let $r_j$ be the row number, such that $p_{r_jj}=1$.
Then,
\begin{align*}
    a_{ij}'' &= \sum_{k=1}^na_{ik}p_{kj} \\
    &= a_{ir_j}p_{r_jj} \\
    &= a_{ir_j},
\end{align*}
which implies that $AP$ is $A$ with its columns permuted.

Now suppose that $A$ is a permutation matrix.
Permuting rows of $A$ preserves the property of permutation matrices that each row and each column has exactly one 1, and 0s elsewhere.
Therefore, $PA$ is also a permutation matrix.
