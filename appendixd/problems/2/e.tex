Observe that $A\cdot0+c=c$, and $Ax=\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}a_jx_j$, where $a_0$, $a_1$, \dots, $a_{n-1}$ are the columns of $A$, so if we let $x=2^i$, then $Ax=a_i$.
Therefore, the linear permutation induced by the pair $(A,0)$ maps $x=0$ to $0$, and maps $x=2^i$ to the number whose binary representation is the $i$th column of $A$.

Consider a permutation $\pi_{A,c}$ of $S_2$, such that $\pi_{A,c}(x)=x$, for $x\in\{0$, 1, $2\}$.
Based on the above observation, this is enough to determine both the matrix $A$ and the vector $c$: $A=I$, $c=0$.
These in turn determine the value $\pi_{A,c}(3)=3$, which makes $\pi_{A,c}$ the identity permutation.
Therefore, any permutation of $S_2$ that maps each $x\in\{0$, 1, $2\}$ to $x$ and 3 to anything else than 3, is impossible to achieve by any linear permutation.
