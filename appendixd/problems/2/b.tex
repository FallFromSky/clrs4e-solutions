We showed in part (a), that the value produced by multiplying a vector $x$ by $A$ does not depend on the $n-r$ entries of $x$ occupying the positions corresponding to the linear dependent columns of $A$.
Therefore, for any $y\in R(A)$, $|P(A,y)|\ge2^{n-r}$.

On the other hand, there are $2^r$ elements in $R(A)$, each with the preimage consisting of at least $2^{n-r}$ elements.
This means, there are at least $2^r\cdot2^{n-r}=2^n$ elements in all preimages in total.
Since $|S_n|=2^n$, each preimage must have exactly $2^{n-r}$ elements.
