The number of linear permutations is bounded above by the number of pairs $(A,c)$, where $A$ is an $n\times n$ 0-1 matrix and $c$ is an $n$-bit vector.
There are $2^{n^2}\!\!\cdot2^n=2^{n(n+1)}$ of such pairs.
On the other hand, there are $(2^n)!$ permutations of $S_n$.
For $n\ge3$, $(2^n)^{n+1}\le(2^n)!$.
