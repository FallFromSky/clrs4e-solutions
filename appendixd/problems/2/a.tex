Let $a_0$, $a_1$, \dots, $a_{n-1}$ be the columns of $A$ and let $J\subseteq\{0$, 1, \dots, $n-1\}$ be the set of indices of all linearly independent columns of $A$.
Consider vectors $x$, $x'\in S_n$, such that there exists $j\in J$ for which $x_j\ne x_j'$, and that for all $j\in\{0$, 1, \dots, $n-1\}-J$, $x_j=x_j'=0$.
Then,
\begin{align*}
    Ax-Ax' &= A(x-x') \\
    &= \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}a_j(x_j-x_j') \\
    &= \sum_{j\in J}a_i(x_j-x_j') \\
    & \ne 0,
\end{align*}
so $Ax\ne Ax'$.
Because $|J|=r$, there are $2^r$ ways of picking the vector $x$, and each such $x$ is mapped to a distinct value $Ax$.
Therefore, $|R(A)|\ge2^r$.

To get the upper bound, observe that any column $a_j$, where $j\notin J$, is in fact a linear combination of the $r$ linearly independent columns of $A$.
Thus, for any vector $x$,
\begin{align*}
    Ax &= \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}a_jx_j \\
    &= \sum_{j\in J}a_jx_j'
\end{align*}
for some coefficients $x_j'$.
In other words, for any $x$ there exists a vector $x'$, with zeros on positions $j\notin J$, mapped to the same value as $x$.
There are $2^r$ ways of choosing such $x'$, so $|R(A)|\le2^r$.

If $\rank(A)<n$, then $|R(A)|<2^n=|S_n|$, so $A$ can't define a permutation on $S_n$.
