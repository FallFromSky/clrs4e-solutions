For any input, the \kw{for} loop of lines 2--4 performs $n-i$ iterations for each $i=1$, 2, \dots, $n-1$, and each iteration of that loop takes constant time.
The total number of the inner loop iterations is
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}(n-i) &= \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}i \\[1mm]
    &= \frac{n(n-1)}{2},
\end{align*}
so the running time of \proc{Bubblesort} is $\Theta(n^2)$.
It is the same as the wost-case running time of \proc{Insertion-Sort}, but worse than its best-case running time.
