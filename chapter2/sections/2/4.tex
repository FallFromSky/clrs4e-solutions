A sorted array does not need to be sorted.
Any sorting algorithm can be modified so that at the beginning it checks whether the input array is sorted, and immediately exits if it is.
The extra step of detecting the ordering of the input elements requires a complete scan of the input array.
Thus, the best-case running time of the algorithm for an input array of length $n$ is $\Theta(n)$.
