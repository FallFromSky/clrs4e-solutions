By \refExercise{C.3-2}, linear search will check $(n+1)/2$ elements on average.
In the worst case all $n$ elements will need to be examined.
Therefore, since the algorithm terminates once either the searched for value has been found, or all elements have been examined, both the average-case and the worst-case running times of linear search are $\Theta(n)$.
