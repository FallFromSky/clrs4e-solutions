In a real-world setting, there are several measures of algorithm efficiency that go beyond just speed.
Some of these include:
\begin{description}
    \item[Memory Usage:] The amount of memory required by an algorithm can significantly impact its efficiency.
    Algorithms that consume excessive memory may not scale well when dealing with large data sets or on systems with limited memory resources.
    It's important to consider the memory requirements of an algorithm to ensure it can run efficiently in different environments.
    \item[Scalability:] An algorithm's ability to handle increasingly larger input sizes without a significant degradation in performance is crucial in real-world scenarios.
    Scalability is particularly important when dealing with big data or high-volume systems where the algorithm needs to process and analyze vast amounts of information.
    \item[Parallelizability:] In modern computing environments, the ability to parallelize an algorithm and leverage multiple processors or distributed systems can greatly enhance efficiency.
    Algorithms that can be effectively parallelized can take advantage of hardware resources and potentially reduce overall processing time.
    \item[I/O Efficiency:] Algorithms that involve reading from or writing to external storage, such as databases or files, need to be mindful of I/O efficiency.
    Minimizing disk accesses or network transfers and optimizing data retrieval and storage techniques can significantly impact the overall performance of an algorithm.
    \item[Energy Consumption:] With the increasing emphasis on energy-efficient computing, algorithms that consume less power are desirable in many real-world settings.
    Optimizing an algorithm to reduce unnecessary computations or limit resource-intensive operations can help conserve energy and improve efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained environments like mobile devices or IoT devices.
    \item[Robustness and Reliability:] Efficiency should not come at the cost of algorithmic robustness and reliability.
    In a real-world setting, algorithms need to handle various edge cases, exceptions, and error conditions gracefully.
    An algorithm that is efficient but lacks robustness may result in incorrect outputs, system failures, or security vulnerabilities.
    \item[Maintainability and Modularity:] In many real-world scenarios, algorithms need to be maintained, extended, or integrated into existing systems.
    The efficiency of an algorithm can be influenced by factors like code readability, ease of understanding, and modularity, which impact the ease of maintenance and future enhancements.
