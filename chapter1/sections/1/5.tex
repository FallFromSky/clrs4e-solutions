When providing critical medical diagnoses, we are interested in finding only the best solutions.
For instance, in complex cases where a patient's life is at stake, accurate and precise diagnoses are crucial.
The healthcare professionals need to identify the exact underlying condition to provide the appropriate treatment plan.
In such situations, the highest level of accuracy is required to ensure the patient's well-being and potentially save lives.

A real-world problem where approximately optimal solution is sufficient is travel planning.
When planning a vacation or business trip, finding the absolute best itinerary might not always be necessary.
For example, when searching for flights, accommodations, and activities, there are often multiple viable options that meet the basic criteria and provide an enjoyable experience.
While it's desirable to find the most cost-effective or time-efficient solution, a reasonably good itinerary that meets most of the traveler's preferences can still lead to a satisfying trip.
The goal is to strike a balance between the available options and the constraints, without necessitating an exhaustive search for the absolute best solution.
