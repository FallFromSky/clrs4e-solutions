The problems are similar in terms of optimizing routes in a graph, but differ in objectives, constraints, and computational complexity:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The shortest-path problem finds the minimum cost path between two nodes, while the traveling-salesperson problem finds the shortest route that visits all nodes exactly once and returns to the starting node.
    \item The shortest-path problem has no constraints, while the traveling-salesperson problem has the constraint of visiting all nodes once.
    \item The shortest-path problem can be solved efficiently, while the traveling-salesperson problem is computationally challenging and has no known polynomial-time solution.
\end{itemize}
